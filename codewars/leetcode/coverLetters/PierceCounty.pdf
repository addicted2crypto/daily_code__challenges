Pierce County Human Resources
Information Technology Department
Tacoma, WA
RE: Senior Systems Analyst Position(or any developer roles)
Dear Hiring Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Systems Analyst position with Pierce County's Information Technology Department. As a Software Engineer with direct experience supporting mission-critical government systems for the Defense Health Agency—including the Military Health System website infrastructure and TRICARE platforms—I bring a proven track record of delivering enterprise solutions within the rigorous requirements of public sector IT.
Why Pierce County and I Align
Pierce County's mission to create a livable community where people choose to live, work, and play resonates deeply with my commitment to public service technology. My current role as a DoD contractor has instilled in me the discipline required for government work: stringent security protocols, comprehensive documentation, accessibility compliance, and the patience to navigate complex stakeholder requirements. I understand that county government IT serves real residents with real needs, and I take that responsibility seriously.
What I Bring:
Enterprise Systems Experience: I maintain enterprise CMS platforms using C#, .NET, and Sitecore while managing complex multi-project architectures. This includes hands-on experience with system analysis, requirements gathering, and translating business needs into technical solutions—core competencies for the Senior Systems Analyst role. Using sitecore shows I can learn any CMS.
Security-First Mindset: My CompTIA Security+ certification and daily implementation of security protocols (end-to-end TLS, VPN configurations, WAF) ensure I approach every system with security as a foundational requirement, not an afterthought. Working hand in had with the DoD everything is security first, Functionality second.
Cross-Functional Collaboration: I built a NestJS SDK that was adopted by four DoD teams, reducing setup time from two days to three hours. This required extensive stakeholder engagement, documentation, and training—skills essential for working across county departments.
I became a facilitating voice across teams to help with effiecency while documenting processes long stuck in developers heads to help cut onboarding time to heavy local building processes by 60%.
Database & Infrastructure Expertise: Proficient in SQL, PostgreSQL, and enterprise database management, with experience optimizing queries and supporting data-driven decision-making for large-scale systems.
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Pierce County's technology infrastructure and serve the community through reliable, secure, and user-centered systems. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my government IT experience and technical expertise can support your department's goals.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
William Heeb
