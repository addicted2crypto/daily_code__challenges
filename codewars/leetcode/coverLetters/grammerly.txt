Dear Superhuman(learned something here!) Hiring Team,
I am writing to express my genuine interest in the Full Stack Engineer position. Your mission—to unlock superhuman potential by eliminating busywork—resonates deeply with how I approach engineering. I've spent my career building systems that scale, that don't fail under pressure, and most importantly, that help people do their best work. That's exactly what Superhuman does for 40 million users.
Why Superhuman and I Align
Building mission-critical systems at scale. At the Defense Health Agency, I don't have the luxury of downtime. The platforms I maintain—mobile.health.mil and TRICARE—serve thousands of concurrent users across DoD. These aren't toys; they're systems that directly impact military personnel and their families. I've architected full-stack solutions that must maintain availability under load, debugged production issues affecting thousands of users, and designed systems that gracefully handle network complexity and strict security constraints. This experience translates directly to Superhuman: I understand what it means to ship features that can't break, to scale infrastructure thoughtfully, and to maintain high availability across consumer and enterprise customers.
Full-stack ownership, end to end. I don't hand off to teammates and move on. I own systems from database schema to user interface. At DHA, I architect NestJS SDKs adopted across four teams (reducing onboarding from 2 days to 3 hours), maintain Sitecore enterprise CMS deployments serving millions of requests, implement end-to-end TLS and VPN tunnel configurations, and debug why things fail under real-world conditions. More recently, I shipped DoD Health IT features on Hyperledger Iroha—the first government blockchain deployment in production. That's full-stack thinking: understanding that infrastructure decisions impact user experience, that API design choices echo through the frontend, that testing and documentation aren't optional.
Shipping velocity without sacrificing quality. Grammarly's pitch is "eliminate busywork." I get that philosophy. At DHA, I don't overthink—I ship(after extensive security is met). The NestJS SDK? Built it, socialized it, got adoption across four teams in weeks. Features on blockchain infrastructure? Shipped in production. Enterprise security requirements? Implemented. But shipping fast doesn't mean shipping poorly. I test, I document, I care obsessively about code quality because lives depend on the systems I build. (Literally—these are military health platforms.) This balance is rare and it's exactly what Superhuman needs.
User obsession. I never lose sight of why code matters. Every commit should make someone's day easier. Grammarly helps people communicate better(and I feel was created for ME), clearer, faster. That's profound. At DHA, I maintain platforms used by people serving their country. The obsession with user experience, with getting the details right, with understanding why someone is using your system—that's baked into how I work. It's not an afterthought; it's foundational.
What I Bring
I bring the technical depth you need (7+ years of full-stack engineering, production systems at scale, React/TypeScript proficiency, infrastructure-as-code thinking) and the operational maturity that comes from high-stakes government contracting. I've worked in the most rigid, security-conscious environments on earth. I've shipped bleeding-edge technology in those contexts. That ability to navigate complexity, maintain quality under constraints, and drive toward user value is rare.
I'm ready to contribute from day one. I've shipped code in the first week of new roles before(reluctantly). I understand that at a growing company like Superhuman, there's no runway for getting up to speed—you need engineers who can jump into codebases, understand them, improve them, and ship features quickly.
Going Forward
I'm genuinely excited about what Superhuman is building and the way the roles read I had to shoot my shot. Grammarly has always represented clarity and precision—tools that respect users' time and intelligence. Coda brings collaboration. Mail handles the noise. Go is proactive assistance. These are products built by engineers who deeply understand user pain. I want to be part of that.
I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my full-stack expertise, production-scale experience, and relentless focus on user value can contribute to your mission.
Thank you for your consideration and truly thank you for Grammarly.
Sincerely,
William Heeb
